# Logistic-Regression
### steps:
#### 1. Selecting features which lead us to  our `target`.
* For predicting `target` in our dataset, we need to consider 4 features from our dataset to deal with.
* Our features are `trestbps, chol, thalach, oldpeak`.
#### 2. Preparing our Data.
* Selecting our features and target from the dataset file.
* Normalizing the data.
* Separating our our data to `training data` and `testing data`.
* Adding Ones column.
* Converting our data to matrices.
* Initialize theta.

#### 3. Implementing the hypothesis function
* our hypothesis function is `Sigmoid Function`

#### 5. Implementing the gradient descent

#### 6. Pedicting `target` values . 
* with X_test data and theta using the hypothesis function we can predict our `target` and compare it with our Y_test.
